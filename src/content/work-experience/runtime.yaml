description:
  - I primarily contributed to "SitePokupok", a wholesale platform. I implemented new features from scratch using React, enhanced initial render times of complex components from 8 seconds to 1 second, and increased test coverage up to 85% using Jest and Gemini (now Hermione). I also migrated the building system to Webpack, improving the overall development process.
  - Beyond my main project, I offered bug fixes and front-end consultations for other company projects and mentored junior engineers.
