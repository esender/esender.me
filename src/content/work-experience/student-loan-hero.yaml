  - I implemented product design features, optimized page speeds, and enhanced the quality of the codebase. I notably reduced webpack build times, conducted continuous refactoring of critical parts of the legacy system, and integrated a new build system, thus accelerating feature release and improving the developer experience. 
  - I also collaborated with a remote engineering team to ensure smooth knowledge transfer following the acquisition of Student Loan Hero by LendingTree.
